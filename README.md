This project entails the development of a comprehensive Personal Digital Diary Management System, integrating SQLite and Flask to establish a robust backend infrastructure. The system features a user-friendly web interface allowing individuals to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their diary entries across four distinct categories: story, poem, travel experience, and article. The frontend seamlessly interacts with the backend, facilitating the storage of user entries in the SQLite database. User authentication is implemented via password protection. The system not only enables users to view and manage their entries through the web interface but also provides direct access to the underlying SQLite database for advanced querying and analysis. This project showcases the effective utilization of frontend and backend technologies to create a dynamic and secure digital diary platform.

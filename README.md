# Personal Digital Diary Management System

This project entails the development of a comprehensive **Personal Digital Diary Management System**, integrating **SQLite** and **Flask** to establish a robust backend infrastructure. The system features a user-friendly web interface allowing individuals to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their diary entries across four distinct categories: **story**, **poem**, **travel experience**, and **article**. 

The frontend seamlessly interacts with the backend, facilitating the storage of user entries in the **SQLite** database. User authentication is implemented via password protection. The system not only enables users to view and manage their entries through the web interface but also provides direct access to the underlying **SQLite** database for advanced querying and analysis. 

This project showcases the effective utilization of frontend and backend technologies to create a dynamic and secure digital diary platform.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQLite
- Email Validator (for email validation)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Open the command prompt or terminal and run the following command to activate the virtual environment:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Upgrade pip**: After activating the virtual environment, upgrade pip by running the following:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

4. **Set Execution Policy (if required)**  
   If you're working with PowerShell and need to change the execution policy to allow running scripts, use the following command:
   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies, including Flask, Werkzeug, and email-validator by running:
   ```bash
   pip install flask werkzeug email-validator
   ```

6. **Run the Application**  
   After installing the dependencies, you can run the Flask application with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the Application**  
   Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

```
